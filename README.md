# Prefix Expression Evaluation Using Stack (C#)

This project demonstrates how to evaluate a **prefix expression** using a **stack** in C#.

## What is Prefix Expression?
In prefix notation, the operator appears **before** its operands.

## Example:
+3-72
Equivalent to:
3 + (7 - 2) = 8

## Features
- Stack-based evaluation
- Supports operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Handles invalid expressions
- Demonstrates LIFO behavior of stacks

## Limitations
- Operands are limited to **single-digit numbers (0–9)**

## Concepts Used
- Stack (LIFO)
- Expression parsing
- Control flow
- Exception handling

## Sample Output
Result = 8

## Technology
- C#
- Console Application
- Visual Studio

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio
2. Build and run the console application
